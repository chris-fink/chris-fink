<h1> Hey There! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<br>
 I'm <a href='https://cfink.dev/'>Chris Fink</a>.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 I'm a self-taught/community-taught developer seeking to transition from logistics & supply chaing industry to become a software developer. I have been studying for the last 7+ months between my full-time job and being a full-time husband to my wife (Katelyn) and father to my son (Otto). Outside of work I love cooking (especially barbeque), watching Formula 1, cheering on Arsenal FC and the Greenville Triumph, and spending time with my family.
 <br>
 <br>
 I believe that tech is the future and can change the world. I am so excited by the possibility to create something that bring positive change to the world. It would be a dream to help build technologies to bring more sustainability to the shipping industry.
 <br><br>
 Lately, I have been been focusing my learning in React, Express, Mongoose, and Tailwind.
